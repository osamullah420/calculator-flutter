# calculator



A new Flutter project.



## Getting Started





This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is a simple calculator project developed for evaluating mathematical expressions. It demonstrates the use of components to construct a reusable Button element, utilizes the **'math_expression'** package from **'pub.dev'** for expression evaluation, and incorporates the **'setState'** function for state management.


## Introduction




This calculator project is designed to showcase the implementation of a reusable Button component using the concept of building blocks. By constructing a reusable Button element, it allows for easy integration and code reusability. Additionally, the project demonstrates how to manage the state of the application using the **'setState'** function. Users can input mathematical expressions and get the result using the *'math_expression'** package from **'pub.dev'**.

## Features

* Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* State management using setState for updating the UI based on user interactions.

## Dependencies

This project utilizes the **math_expressions** package from pub.dev.

To include the package in your own Flutter project, add the following line to your pubspec.yaml file.


  
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  math_expression: ^latest_version'
