# calculator

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is a simple calculator project developed for evaluating mathematical expressions. It demonstrates the use of components to construct a reusable Button element, utilizes the **math_expression** package from **pub.dev** for expression evaluation, and incorporates the **setState** function for state management.


## Introduction

This calculator project is designed to showcase the implementation of a reusable Button component using the concept of building blocks. By constructing a reusable Button element, it allows for easy integration and code reusability. Additionally, the project demonstrates how to manage the state of the application using the **setState** function. Users can input mathematical expressions and get the result using the **math_expression** package from **pub.dev**.

## Features

Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

State management using setState for updating the UI based on user interactions.

## Dependencies

This project utilizes the **math_expressions** package from pub.dev:

To include the package in your own Flutter project, add the following line to your pubspec.yaml file:

<---dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  math_expression: ^latest_version--->
